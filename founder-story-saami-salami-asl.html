      <span>By Saami Salami Asl — Founder of Elisence</span>
    </div>

    <div class="article-body">

      <h2>1. Introduction: A Founder’s Path</h2>
      <p>
        Behind every global platform lies a personal story — a story of resilience, clarity,
        loss, rebuilding, learning and deep commitment. Elisence was not born from theory or
        corporate research; it was born from real life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Saami Salami Asl (also known as Sami Salami) carries a journey shaped by engineering,
        law, healthcare systems, and a profound understanding of family, responsibility and human
        wellbeing.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Engineering, Law & Human Complexity</h2>
      <p>
        Before entering law, Saami studied electrical engineering — a discipline that shaped his
        structured, system-level way of thinking. Later, the legal world strengthened his ability to
        analyse risk, safety, evidence and human behaviour at the deepest levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        These two domains together — engineering + law — became the foundation of Elisence.
      </p>

      <h2>3. A Father’s Experience That Changed Everything</h2>
      <p>
        The emotional core of Elisence began with another journey: fatherhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through years of separation, international legal challenges, and fighting to stay connected
        with his daughter Elisa, Saami experienced firsthand the gaps, weaknesses and fragmentation
        inside today’s human and family support systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        It revealed something important:
      </p>
      <p><strong>The world needs a platform that is human, safe, trusted — and built for real life.</strong></p>

      <h2>4. Building Elisence: A Global Human-Health Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>
        With that clarity, Saami designed Elisence — a sovereign, non-diagnostic, multi-language,
        Zero-Trust health and humanity platform built across 17 phases, each a complete engine:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Women+ Health</li>
        <li>Diabetes & metabolic care</li>
        <li>Family support & child wellbeing</li>
        <li>Global nutrition intelligence</li>
        <li>Voice-based companion systems</li>
        <li>National-scale dashboards for ministries</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At its core, Elisence is a platform built not only with technical excellence, but with
        empathy, transparency and humanity.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Why This Founder Story Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Many digital health founders come from business backgrounds.
        Saami comes from **life**, engineering, law, fatherhood, and a mission for global health clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        His experience — personal and professional — directly shaped Elisence’s philosophy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Safe, explainable AI</li>
        <li>Non-diagnostic boundaries</li>
        <li>Full transparency</li>
        <li>Five-language inclusivity</li>
        <li>Family-first design</li>
        <li>Zero-Trust architecture for all ages</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Conclusion: A Founder Driven by Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The journey of Saami Salami Asl is not just a biography — it is the blueprint behind Elisence.
        It is a story that shows how personal struggle, engineering discipline, legal clarity and
        global vision can come together to create a platform that protects, supports and empowers millions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elisence is more than a project.
      </p>
      <p><strong>It is a mission built from life itself.</strong></p>
