  <h1>Interview — Weight Intelligence, GLP-1 and Phase 3</h1>
  <p>In conversation with Saami (Sami) Salami about building a safe weight and lifestyle engine inside Elisence</p>
</div>

<div class="container">

  <div class="meta">
    Interviewee: <strong>Saami (Sami) Salami</strong> · Founder of Elisence<br>
    Topic: Phase 3, GLP-1, and why Elisence treats weight as a long-term health journey.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Why did you decide to build a weight-focused phase inside Elisence?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: There are thousands of diet apps. Why did Elisence need Phase 3?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Because most of those apps focus on fast numbers, not real lives.  
      Phase 3 was created to look at weight as part of a <strong>wider health story</strong>:
      sleep, mood, GLP-1 treatment, family stress, and long-term risks like diabetes and heart disease.
      I wanted a system that respects biology and psychology instead of selling quick fixes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>2. Your own GLP-1 experience</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: You have personal experience with GLP-1 medications. How did that shape Phase 3?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: It made everything very real. I saw how powerful these drugs can be for appetite and weight,
      but also how important it is to have <strong>structure, monitoring, and honest expectations</strong>.
      Phase 3 doesn’t glorify GLP-1 and it doesn’t demonise it.  
      Instead, it helps people and clinicians see: <em>What is happening? What is safe? What is changing?</em>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: So Phase 3 tells people what dose to take or how to use GLP-1?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: No. Elisence is very clear: we are <strong>not</strong> a prescribing system.  
      Phase 3 is about <strong>tracking, understanding, and coaching</strong> around weight and lifestyle.
      Any decision about medication belongs to doctors and official guidelines, not to our algorithms.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>3. What does “Weight Intelligence” mean in practice?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: You use the phrase “Weight Intelligence” instead of “weight loss app”. Why?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Because we are not selling a number on the scale.  
      Weight Intelligence means we combine:
      <br>• <strong>data</strong> — weight, trends, simple behaviours  
      <br>• <strong>context</strong> — sleep, movement, medication, stress  
      <br>• <strong>safe education</strong> — what the trends might mean, without diagnosing  
      to help a person see their own pattern clearly.  
      Sometimes the right move is more movement, sometimes better sleep, sometimes talking to a doctor.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: How does Phase 3 avoid becoming another “before/after” marketing tool?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: We deliberately avoid aggressive promises.  
      No “lose 10 kg in 10 days”. No “miracle reset”.  
      Instead, we track <strong>steady progress</strong>, highlight non-scale victories like energy, mood,
      and clothes fitting, and we keep language grounded and respectful.  
      This is especially important for people who already feel judged by health systems.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>4. Safety, data, and long-term health</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Weight data can be sensitive. How is it handled inside Elisence?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Weight data is treated with the same seriousness as any other health signal.
      It goes through <strong>Zero-Trust</strong> controls, is protected by <strong>WORM-style</strong> audit,
      and it only appears where the person explicitly allows it.  
      If a family shares data with a clinic or programme, there is a clear, auditable record of that choice.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: How does Phase 3 connect to diabetes and other conditions?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Phase 3 is designed to work closely with the Diabetes Phase (Phase 9) and the Nutrition Phase (Phase 16).
      For example, weight trends can inform a diabetes risk view, and nutrition patterns from GNIE can explain
      why a plateau is happening.  
      All of this is done in a <strong>non-diagnostic</strong> way, but it creates a rich picture for people
      and, where appropriate, for clinicians.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>5. What message do you have for someone starting a weight journey with Elisence?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: If someone opens Elisence today and starts logging their weight, what would you say to them?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: I would say: <strong>be kind to yourself and be curious</strong>.  
      Elisence is not here to shout at you. It is here to help you see what is really happening,
      step by step.  
      Use the trends, use the gentle coaching, and if at any point you are worried about your health,
      talk to a professional. Your value is not your weight; the numbers are just one signal in a bigger story.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>6. Where can people learn more about Phase 3?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Where can someone go deeper into the technical side of Phase 3?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: They can start with:
      <br>• the main <a href="../articles/what-is-elisence.html">“What Is Elisence?”</a> article  
      <br>• the weight and lifestyle sections of our <a href="press-kit.html">Press &amp; Media Kit</a>  
      <br>• and, for professionals, the longer Elisence phase reports covering Phase 3, Phase 9 (Diabetes),
      and Phase 16 (Nutrition).
