  <h1>Timeline — Building Elisence</h1>
  <p>Key milestones in the journey of Saami Salami and the Elisence platform.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">

  <div class="event">
    <h3>Early Concept — Connecting Health &amp; Family Life</h3>
    <span>Concept Stage</span>
    <p>
      The first idea for Elisence emerged from real experiences with fragmented health systems,
      complex legal processes, and the emotional reality of families trying to manage care.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h3>Phase 1–3 — Core Infrastructure &amp; Care Engine</h3>
    <span>Foundations</span>
    <p>
      Saami focused on building a solid backbone: core APIs, safety boundaries,
      and a care/weight-loss engine that could later support more advanced phases.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h3>Phase 4 — Elisence Core Infrastructure</h3>
    <span>Stability &amp; Governance</span>
    <p>
      Work on Phase 4 centred on governance, interoperability, and performance —
      preparing Elisence for real-world expectations from clinics and ministries.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h3>Phase 7 — Women+ Health &amp; Life Companion</h3>
    <span>Women+ Focus</span>
    <p>
      Saami designed the Women+ engine as a respectful, non-diagnostic companion
      for cycle health, pregnancy, postpartum journeys, and pain/symptom awareness.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h3>Phase 8 — AHE &amp; Zero-Trust / Risk Engines</h3>
    <span>Advanced Health Engine</span>
    <p>
      The AHE work brought together risk modelling, safety contracts, and Zero-Trust architecture,
      making sure Elisence behaves in a predictable, testable, and auditable way.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h3>Phase 9 — Diabetes &amp; GLP-1 Intelligence</h3>
    <span>Chronic Care</span>
    <p>
      Diabetes intelligence was built as a way to structure events, patterns, and lifestyle links —
      supporting clinicians and patients without giving direct treatment decisions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h3>Phases 15–17 — Families, Nutrition, Mental Health</h3>
    <span>0–18, GNIE, CalmNow</span>
    <p>
      Saami extended Elisence into the Family Ecosystem (0–18), Global Nutrition Intelligence,
      and Mental Health &amp; Calm support — always with clear non-diagnostic boundaries.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="event">
    <h3>Public Web &amp; Investor-Ready Layer</h3>
    <span>Public Presence</span>
    <p>
      With the technical core maturing, Saami began building the public website, reports, videos,
      and founder materials to present Elisence to ministries, investors, and partners.
