  <h1>Interview — Women+ Health and Phase 7</h1>
  <p>In conversation with Saami (Sami) Salami about building a respectful digital companion for women’s health</p>
</div>

<div class="container">

  <div class="meta">
    Interviewee: <strong>Saami (Sami) Salami</strong> · Founder of Elisence<br>
    Topic: Women+ Phase 7 — cycle, pregnancy, postpartum, and pain intelligence with strict safety boundaries.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Why did you create a dedicated Women+ phase?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Many platforms add “women’s health” as one feature. Why does Elisence have a full Women+ phase?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Because women’s health is not a feature — it is a whole world.  
      Periods, pregnancy, postpartum, pain, hormones, fertility, and mental health are deeply connected.
      They deserve their own <strong>governance, language, and safety rules</strong>, not just a calendar
      inside a generic app.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>2. Non-diagnostic by design</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Does Women+ Phase 7 diagnose conditions like endometriosis or PCOS?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: No. That is a hard line we do not cross.  
      Women+ Phase 7 is a <strong>companion and pattern explainer</strong>, not a diagnostic system.
      It can help someone notice “this pattern looks unusual”, or “this pain is frequent and strong”,
      and then encourage them to <strong>see a professional</strong>.  
      We never say “you have X” or “you are safe to ignore Y”.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Why are you so strict about this boundary?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Because women have already suffered from being dismissed, misdiagnosed, or over-confidently treated
      by systems that did not listen properly.  
      Elisence should not become another voice making big claims. It should be a tool that
      <strong>organises symptoms, patterns, and questions</strong> so that real doctors can make better decisions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>3. Respectful language and emotional safety</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: How do you make sure the language in Elisence is respectful to women?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: We follow a simple rule: <strong>no blame, no shame</strong>.  
      The tone is calm, informative, and kind. We avoid phrases that judge body shape, fertility,
      or sexual activity. We recognise that many women carry trauma, fear, or past bad experiences
      with healthcare, and we design the text to feel <strong>supportive, not interrogating</strong>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Do you treat women as data points or as people with a story?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Always as people with a story. Data helps us see patterns, but we never forget that behind
      every data point there is pain, hope, or worry. The goal of Phase 7 is to help women feel
      <strong>seen and taken seriously</strong>, even before they walk into a clinic.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>4. Safety for pregnancy and postpartum</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: How does Phase 7 handle pregnancy and postpartum?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Very carefully. We treat pregnancy and postpartum as high-sensitivity contexts.
      The system focuses on:
      <br>• tracking symptoms and patterns  
      <br>• explaining which kinds of changes are <em>commonly seen</em> versus <em>potentially worrying</em>  
      <br>• <strong>encouraging early contact</strong> with midwives, doctors, or emergency services when needed  
      We do not replace clinical triage or give green-light decisions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Do you include mental health after birth?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Yes. Postpartum emotional health is part of Women+ Phase 7.  
      We never label or diagnose, but we help women notice patterns like persistent sadness,
      anxiety, or intrusive thoughts, and we gently recommend <strong>speaking to a professional
      or trusted person</strong>. Silence is what hurts the most; Elisence should help break that silence safely.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>5. Privacy and control over sensitive data</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Women’s health data is extremely sensitive. How is it protected?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Women+ data is protected by the same core as the rest of Elisence:
      <strong>Zero-Trust security, AKAC-style privacy supervision, and WORM audit logs</strong>.  
      Access is always explicit and limited. If data is shared with a clinic or a programme,
      that sharing is recorded and <strong>can be reviewed</strong>. No silent data flows.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Can women choose to keep everything local and private?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Yes. The design allows for modes where data stays with the user unless they actively decide
      to connect to a service. The idea is simple: the woman owns her story; Elisence just helps her
      <strong>organise and understand it</strong>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>6. What does success look like for Women+ Phase 7?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: When you think about success for Phase 7, what do you see?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: I see women who feel less dismissed and more prepared.  
      I see better conversations in clinics because symptoms and timelines are already captured.
      I see ministries using anonymised, aggregated insights to improve services for women —
      without exposing individual lives.  
      If even one woman avoids a delay in care because Phase 7 helped her be heard sooner,
      that is already meaningful.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>7. Where can people learn more about Women+ in Elisence?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Where should someone start if they want to go deeper into Women+?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: They can start with:
      <br>• the article <a href="../articles/women-health.html">“Women+ Health — Why It Matters”</a>  
      <br>• our <a href="press-kit.html">Press &amp; Media Kit</a> for high-level summaries  
      <br>• and, for regulators or partners, the full Phase 7 roadmap and reports we provide on request.
