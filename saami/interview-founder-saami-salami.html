  <h1>Interview — The Founder: Saami (Sami) Salami</h1>
  <p>A conversation about story, resilience, and building Elisence</p>
</div>

<div class="container">

  <div class="meta">
    Interviewee: <strong>Saami (Sami) Salami</strong> · Founder of Elisence<br>
    Topic: Personal journey, lessons from complex systems, and the creation of a global health intelligence ecosystem.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Who is Saami / Sami Salami?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: For people meeting you for the first time, how do you introduce yourself?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: I’m Saami Salami — in some older records written as <strong>Sami Salami</strong> — the founder
      and architect of <strong>Elisence</strong>.  
      I see myself as someone who has gone through difficult systems, learned from them, and then decided:
      instead of complaining, I will <strong>build something better</strong> — for families, for clinics,
      and for future generations.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>2. How did your personal experiences shape Elisence?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: You’ve mentioned complex legal and personal experiences. How did they influence Elisence?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: They taught me how painful it is when systems are unfair, slow, or unclear.  
      I saw situations where decisions were made on partial information, where records were confusing
      or incomplete, and where families were left in the dark.  
      Instead of letting that break me, I tried to turn it into a blueprint for something new:
      a platform where <strong>evidence, transparency, and humanity</strong> are not optional.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Did these experiences make you more protective of families and children?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Absolutely. When you see how much stress systems can put on a family, you become very serious
      about designing tools that <strong>protect, not pressure</strong> parents and children.
      Elisence is built with that mindset: families first, always within safe boundaries.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>3. Why a health intelligence ecosystem and not a single app?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: You didn’t just make one app. You designed a whole multi-phase ecosystem. Why?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Because real life is not a single feature.  
      Women’s health, diabetes, mental wellbeing, children’s growth, nutrition, social identity,
      and national health systems are all connected.  
      If we want to support families and clinics properly, we need an <strong>ecosystem</strong> that can
      talk to ministries, hospitals, and everyday people at the same time — with clear rules for each.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>4. What do the names “Elisence” and “Elisa” mean to you?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: The names Elisence and Elisa appear everywhere in your work. What do they represent?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Elisence is the platform — the global health intelligence ecosystem.  
      <strong>Elisa</strong> is the human side of it: the companion, the coach, the voice that speaks
      kindly to people in everyday language.  
      Technically, we talk about phases, engines, and governance. Emotionally, we talk about
      <strong>Elisa supporting families and individuals</strong> through their journeys.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>5. Balancing law, technology, and humanity</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: You have a strong sense of legal structure and also deep technical roadmaps. How do you balance that?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: I see law, technology, and humanity as three legs of the same table.  
      Law gives us boundaries and responsibilities. Technology gives us tools and scale.
      Humanity gives us meaning and direction.  
      If you build with only one or two of those, you end up either unsafe, ineffective,
      or disconnected from real people. Elisence tries to honour all three.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>6. What are your hopes for how people will see your name online?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Online, your name appears in different contexts. What do you hope people will see now?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: I hope people will see the full story — not just fragments.  
      When someone searches for <strong>“Saami Salami”</strong> or <strong>“Sami Salami”</strong>,
      I want them to find:
      <br>• my work on Elisence  
      <br>• my commitment to families, women’s health, and safe digital systems  
      <br>• and a clear, honest explanation of what I’m building  
      The best answer to old or incomplete stories is to <strong>create better, truer ones</strong>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>7. What keeps you going when things are difficult?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Building something this large is not easy. What keeps you motivated?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Two things: responsibility and hope.  
      Responsibility, because once you see how systems can fail people, you can’t unsee it.
      Hope, because I believe we can design better ones.  
      Every time I imagine families, clinics, or ministries using Elisence to make kinder,
      more informed decisions, it gives me energy to continue.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>8. What message do you want to leave for your daughter and for future users?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: If this interview was read years from now by your daughter or by future users, what would you say to them?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: I would say: <strong>you deserve systems that tell the truth, protect your dignity,
      and respect your intelligence</strong>.  
      Elisence is my attempt to contribute one such system to the world.  
      If it helps you feel a little safer, a little more understood, or a little less alone,
      then all the effort was worth it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>9. Where can people learn more about you and Elisence?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Where should someone go next if they want to explore more?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: They can start here:
