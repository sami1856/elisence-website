  <h1>Interview — Family Ecosystem (0–18)</h1>
  <p>In conversation with Saami (Sami) Salami about building a safe, intelligent companion for children, teens, and parents</p>

    Interviewee: <strong>Saami (Sami) Salami</strong> · Founder of Elisence<br>
    Topic: Phase 15 — the Family Ecosystem Assistant covering growth, sleep, nutrition, digital safety, school life, and bonding.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Why build a full 0–18 ecosystem inside Elisence?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Most apps focus only on pregnancy or baby tracking. Why create a full 0–18 companion?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Because childhood is not just the first year.  
      Families need support through every stage: newborn, childhood, puberty, teen mental health,
      digital safety, school pressure, sleep cycles, nutrition, emotional development.  
      Phase 15 treats the family as a <strong>connected ecosystem</strong>, not isolated moments.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>2. What problems does Phase 15 solve for parents?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: What do parents struggle with the most today?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Information overload and lack of trustworthy guidance.  
      Parents jump between Instagram pages, Google searches, WhatsApp groups, and clinic visits,
      trying to understand what’s normal and what needs attention.  
      Phase 15 gives one calm, safe, step-by-step place where parents can track growth, sleep, school,
      behaviour, and emotional signals — without being scared by random online advice.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>3. Growth, sleep, and emotional intelligence</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: What makes the Elisence approach to children’s wellbeing different?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: We connect the dots.  
      Instead of treating growth, sleep, nutrition, emotional states, and screen time separately,
      we show how they influence each other.  
      And we do it with <strong>non-diagnostic, calm explanations</strong> — no fear, no panic.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Do you include behavioural patterns?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Yes, but respectfully.  
      We never label a child.  
      We help parents observe patterns like irritability, low focus, fatigue, or sleep disruption,
      and we show gentle possibilities — not diagnoses — so they can talk to teachers or clinicians
      with clearer information.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>4. Digital safety for kids and teens</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Digital risks are a big issue for families. How does Phase 15 help?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: We focus on <strong>awareness, boundaries, and early signals</strong>.  
      Not spying, not invading.  
      The goal is to help parents understand:
      <br>• screen-time patterns  
      <br>• risky content exposure  
      <br>• sleep disruption caused by devices  
      <br>• emotional signals linked to social media  
      And we always keep the child’s dignity and privacy at the centre.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>5. Schools & ministries</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: How does Phase 15 work with schools or ministries?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Through <strong>anonymised, aggregated insights</strong> — never individual child records.  
      Schools can understand patterns like sleep issues, stress, nutrition trends, or digital behaviour
      across classes or age groups.  
      Ministries get a national picture of children’s wellbeing for planning and policy-making,
      without exposing any child’s private data.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>6. How do you protect children’s privacy?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Children’s data is the most sensitive type. What safeguards do you use?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: We use the full Elisence backbone:
      <br>• <strong>Zero-Trust identity & access control</strong>  
      <br>• <strong>WORM audit logs</strong>  
      <br>• <strong>Consent-based sharing</strong>  
      <br>• <strong>k-anonymity</strong> for aggregated insights  
      A child’s life story should never be exposed or misused. Privacy is non-negotiable.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>7. A healthier digital childhood</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: What does success look like for Phase 15?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Success is when children grow up with:
      <br>• better sleep  
      <br>• healthier nutrition  
      <br>• cleaner digital habits  
      <br>• supportive school environments  
      <br>• and parents who feel confident, not overwhelmed  
      If Elisence can reduce stress and improve wellbeing even a little,
      that will impact entire families for years.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>8. Where can people learn more about Phase 15?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Where should someone start?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A:
      <br>• the main <a href="../articles/family-0-18.html">Family 0–18 article</a>  
      <br>• the <a href="../founder-saami.html">Founder page</a>
