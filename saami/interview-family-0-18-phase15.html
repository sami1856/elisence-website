  <h1>Interview — Family Ecosystem 0–18 (Phase 15)</h1>
  <p>In conversation with Saami (Sami) Salami about the future of safe, connected family wellbeing</p>
</div>

<div class="container">

  <div class="meta">
    Interviewee: <strong>Saami (Sami) Salami</strong> · Founder of Elisence<br>
    Topic: The Family Ecosystem Assistant — health, growth, nutrition, sleep, emotions, digital safety, and bonding.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Why did Elisence create a full Family Ecosystem for ages 0–18?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: What was the biggest motivation behind Phase 15?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Every parent knows that raising a child is not one topic — it’s hundreds.
      Sleep, growth, nutrition, school, screen time, emotional development, safety, friendships…
      Families need one place that helps them understand all of this safely,
      without surveillance and without judgement.  
      That’s why Phase 15 was created: a <strong>family operating system</strong> that connects everything.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>2. What makes Phase 15 different from parenting apps?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: There are apps for babies, apps for teens, and apps for schools. How is this different?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Most apps are “single-issue”. Baby sleep. Teen safety. Homework.
      Phase 15 connects all life stages — from newborn to 18 — into one continuous picture.  
      We built:
      <br>• growth and development tracking  
      <br>• sleep and behaviour insights  
      <br>• nutrition guidance (connected to Phase 16 GNIE)  
      <br>• emotional and mental wellbeing support  
      <br>• digital safety and screen-time intelligence  
      <br>• parent–child bonding modules  
      <br>• school connections (aggregated, anonymised insights only)
      <br><br>
      This is not a toy. This is a <strong>governance-aware family layer</strong>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>3. Digital safety and healthy dopamine</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Digital safety for children is a big concern. How do you handle it?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: With a lot of respect and responsibility.  
      Phase 15 avoids fear-based monitoring. Instead we analyse patterns:
      <br>• screen habits  
      <br>• night-time usage  
      <br>• risky online behaviours  
      <br>• exposure to harmful content  
      <br><br>
      And we give calm, educational guidance to families.  
      No spying. No punishment. Just safe awareness and healthier habits.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: You also talk about “healthy dopamine”. What does that mean for children?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Many digital products are built to capture attention, not to protect children.
      Phase 15 promotes <strong>positive dopamine</strong>: achievements, progress, learning moments,
      family activities, sleep wins.  
      We avoid addictive loops — and instead reward real-life growth.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>4. Emotional and behavioural patterns</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: How do you support emotional health without diagnosing?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: By focusing on <strong>patterns, not labels</strong>.  
      We show families helpful signals:
      <br>• mood trends  
      <br>• school stress  
      <br>• sleep–emotion relationships  
      <br>• behavioural changes  
      <br><br>
      And then we give <strong>safe, non-diagnostic guidance</strong>, always recommending contact
      with professionals if something feels concerning.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>5. Privacy and ethical design for minors</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Minors’ data is extremely sensitive. How do you protect it?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: With the strictest rules in the entire Elisence ecosystem.  
      Children’s data follows:
      <br>• <strong>Zero-Trust</strong> identity and access  
      <br>• <strong>WORM audit</strong> for every access  
      <br>• <strong>k-anonymity</strong> for school-level insights  
      <br>• parental controls with clear consent steps  
      <br><br>
      No child’s record is ever shared with a school or ministry individually —
      everything is aggregated and anonymised by policy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>6. Family bonding and real-life wellbeing</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Phase 15 also talks about bonding and family moments. Why?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Because wellbeing is not only medical.  
      Bonding activities, shared achievements, learning projects, and positive memories
      build a healthier family environment.  
      Technology should support families — not replace them.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>7. What does success look like for Phase 15?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: How do you define success for the Family Ecosystem?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Success is when families feel:
      <br>• more connected  
      <br>• less stressed  
      <br>• more informed  
      <br>• and more confident in raising their children  
      If a parent says: “Elisence helped me understand my child better,” that is a win.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>8. Where can people learn more about Phase 15?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: What are the next steps if someone wants to understand Phase 15 deeper?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: They can explore:
      <br>• the article <a href="../articles/family-0-18.html">“Family Ecosystem 0–18”</a>  
      <br>• our <a href="press-kit.html">Press &amp; Media Kit</a>  
      <br>• and the official roadmap for Phase 15, which we share with ministries and partners.
