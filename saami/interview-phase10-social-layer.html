  <h1>Interview — Phase 10: Social Layer, Messaging &amp; Security</h1>
  <p>In conversation with Saami (Sami) Salami about building a safe social layer for health and families</p>
</div>

<div class="container">

  <div class="meta">
    Interviewee: <strong>Saami (Sami) Salami</strong> · Founder of Elisence<br>
    Topic: Phase 10 — messaging, public profiles, attachments vault, and Zero-Trust social design.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Why does a health platform need a social layer?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: People think of social apps as Instagram and WhatsApp. Why add something like that to Elisence?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Because health is never just lab results. It’s conversations, support, family chats,
      shared progress, and encouragement.  
      If we leave the social part outside, people will still use other platforms — but with
      <strong>no governance, no audit, and no control</strong> over where their health-related content goes.
      Phase 10 brings messaging and sharing <strong>inside</strong> a safer, regulated environment.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>2. How is Phase 10 different from normal messengers?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: What makes Phase 10 different from just using a normal chat app?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Normal messengers are built for speed and engagement.  
      Phase 10 is built for <strong>traceability, consent, and safety</strong>.  
      We have:
      <br>• <strong>consent-first message requests</strong> — people can control who may contact them  
      <br>• an <strong>Attachments Vault</strong> where files stay under Elisence rules, not random clouds  
      <br>• <strong>Zero-Trust identity headers</strong> and clear roles (family, clinician, coach, org)  
      <br>• and a design that avoids addictive feeds and toxic dopamine.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: So can users post anything publicly like on social media?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: We allow public sharing in a <strong>very controlled</strong> way.  
      For example, people can share achievements or safe educational content, but we do not open
      a free-for-all medical forum. Public content is treated as part of the <strong>Elisence identity layer</strong>,
      not a place for random, unsafe advice.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>3. Public profiles and reputation</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: What is the idea behind public profiles in Phase 10?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Public profiles let professionals and, later, organisations show a verified presence:
      clinics, coaches, future Pro accounts, and so on.  
      The goal is to combine:
      <br>• <strong>clear identity</strong> (who is this person or organisation?)  
      <br>• <strong>boundaries</strong> (what are they allowed to do inside Elisence?)  
      <br>• <strong>evidence</strong> (what they share can be audited, not just deleted and forgotten)
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: And what about normal users and families?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Normal users can have profiles with privacy-first defaults.  
      They choose what to share, with whom, and for how long.  
      The intention is to support <strong>healthy visibility</strong> — celebrating progress, community
      support — without exposing personal medical stories to the whole internet.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>4. Attachments Vault and file safety</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Can you explain the Attachments Vault in simple terms?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: The Attachments Vault is where files live under Elisence rules.  
      Instead of being spread across random chats and clouds, documents and images are stored
      with:
      <br>• <strong>role-based access</strong> — who can see what, and for how long  
      <br>• <strong>WORM-style audit</strong> — who opened or shared a file, recorded transparently  
      <br>• <strong>Zero-Trust checks</strong> on every access  
      It’s the opposite of sending a lab result to ten apps and losing control forever.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>5. Avoiding toxic engagement</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Social platforms often become addictive or harmful. How do you avoid that?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: We treat dopamine as a design responsibility.  
      Phase 10 avoids infinite scroll, drama-heavy content, and aggressive notifications.
      Instead, we reward:
      <br>• consistent healthy habits  
      <br>• learning moments  
      <br>• supportive interactions  
      not just clicks.  
      The idea is <strong>calm engagement</strong>, not anxiety and comparison.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>6. How does Phase 10 connect with other phases?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Where does Phase 10 sit inside the bigger Elisence ecosystem?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: Phase 10 is the <strong>vitrine and social identity layer</strong>.  
      It connects to:
      <br>• Women+ (Phase 7) — for sharing safe educational content and women’s support  
      <br>• Diabetes (Phase 9) — for progress sharing, educator interaction, and safe file exchange  
      <br>• Family 0–18 (Phase 15) — for parents, schools, and kids’ digital safety  
      All of this runs on the same security and governance core.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>7. What should ministries and clinics know about Phase 10?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: If a ministry of health or a clinic is evaluating Elisence, what is the key message about Phase 10?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: The key message is that Phase 10 is not “just another chat”.  
      It is a <strong>controlled, auditable communication and identity layer</strong> designed for
      health contexts.  
      Every message, file, and profile sits under clear policies, not just terms and conditions
      that nobody reads. That’s what makes it fit for serious partnerships.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>8. Where can people learn more about Phase 10?</h2>

  <div class="qa-block">
    <p class="q">Q: Where can someone go deeper into the design of Phase 10?</p>
    <p class="a">
      A: They can start with:
      <br>• the main <a href="../founder-saami.html">Founder</a> page  
      <br>• the <a href="press-kit.html">Press &amp; Media Kit</a> for high-level explanations  
      <br>• and the Elisence Phase 10 technical and governance reports, which we share with
      serious partners and regulators.
