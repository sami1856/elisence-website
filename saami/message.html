  <h2>To Families, Clinics, and Future Partners</h2>

  <p>
    Thank you for taking the time to learn about Elisence.  
    This platform was created with one purpose: to make health information safer, clearer,
    and more human — for every family, every clinic, and every country.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the past years, I experienced how easily information can be misunderstood, how digital
    systems can fail people, and how quickly trust can be damaged.  
    These experiences shaped the foundation of Elisence.  
    I wanted a system where <strong>safety, transparency, and honesty</strong> come first — not marketing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Elisence is built step-by-step with strict rules:
    Zero-Trust security, non-diagnostic boundaries, WORM auditing, multi-language support,
    and clear privacy controls for families and clinics.
  </p>

  <p>
    What we are building is bigger than an app.  
    It is a <strong>global health intelligence ecosystem</strong> that protects people’s dignity, data,
    and family life — while offering modern tools for ministries, clinics, and researchers.
  </p>

  <h2>A Personal Note</h2>
  <p>
    My name appears in different spellings online — <strong>Sami Salami</strong> and 
    <strong>Saami Salami</strong> — but both refer to the same person.  
    I stand behind every page of Elisence and every rule we set.  
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to understand why trust, evidence, and governance matter to me,
    you can read:

  </ul>

  <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
  <p>
    We will keep expanding Elisence with care — Family 0–18, Diabetes Intelligence, Women+ Health,
    Global Nutrition Intelligence, Mental Health, and more.  
    Every phase will be built with responsibility and respect.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being part of this journey.  
    The best chapters are still ahead.
