  <h1>A Message from Saami</h1>
  <p>Why Elisence exists — in simple words.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">

  <h2>To Anyone Reading This</h2>
  <p>
    Elisence was not created in a lab. It was born from real experiences:
    legal battles, health worries, family responsibilities, and the feeling that
    digital tools were not truly built for the people who need them most.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wanted to build something that respects how complicated real life is —
    especially for women, families, and people living with long-term conditions.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Want Elisence to Be</h2>
  <p>
    I don’t want Elisence to be just another app on a crowded phone screen.
    I want it to be a trusted companion and a serious platform —
    something that doctors, ministries, and families can all look at and say:
    “This is careful. This is honest. This is trying to help, not just to grow numbers.”
  </p>

  <h2>For Families, Clinicians, and Ministries</h2>
  <p>
    If you are a parent, I hope Elisence can make things a little clearer and less lonely.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are a clinician, I hope it can help you see patterns and timelines more easily,
    without crossing clinical lines or adding noise.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are part of a ministry or public health organisation,
    I hope Elisence can give you safer, cleaner signals — so that planning and prevention
    can be based on real, anonymised trends, not guesswork.
  </p>

  <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
  <p>
    Elisence is still growing. There will be mistakes and lessons along the way.
    But the core promise stays the same: to build something that respects people,
    protects their data, and supports health in a human way.
