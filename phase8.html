    <h1>Advanced Health Engine (AHE)</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        Phase 8 is the governed medical intelligence layer of Elisence – the point where Elisence stops being “an app”
        and becomes <strong>national health infrastructure</strong>. It unifies signals from women’s health, blood,
        diabetes, behaviour, devices, and environment into safe, non-diagnostic intelligence for citizens, clinicians,
        hospitals and ministries.
    </p>

    <p class="tagline">
        Safe for citizens. Structured for clinicians. Governed for ministries. Built for NHS / EU MDR / FDA / GCC.
    </p>

    <!-- 0. EXECUTIVE POSITIONING -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>0. Executive Positioning — What Phase 8 Actually Is</h2>
        <p>
            Phase 8 (AHE – Advanced Health Engine) is not a single feature and not a monolithic “AI risk score”.
            It is a multi-core health infrastructure that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collects signals from women’s health, blood tests, diabetes, behaviour, devices and environment.</li>
            <li>Normalises and interprets them in a safe, non-diagnostic, explainable way.</li>
            <li>Produces calm, human-readable guidance for citizens and structured, auditable risk views for clinicians and ministries.</li>
            <li>Runs with high-risk medical features OFF by default, activatable only via explicit feature flags and governance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="highlight-box">
            Mission: reduce pressure on health systems by catching risk earlier, educating citizens better, and giving
            clinicians and ministers structured, trustworthy intelligence instead of noise.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 1. SEVEN-CORE MODEL -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>1. The Seven-Core Model — How Phase 8 Is Structured</h2>
        <p>
            Phase 8 is explicitly built as seven governed Cores, each with its own risk profile, feature flags and
            governance. Risk is isolated rather than blended.
        </p>

        <h3>Core-1 — Women (11K)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Women’s contextual health knowledge and risk signals.</li>
            <li>Powered by Women AHE 11K (views_v1 + Women signals engine).</li>
            <li>Role-aware outputs for citizens, clinicians, and ministries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Core-2 — Blood / Hematology</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unified blood schema (<code>AHE_Blood_Profile_v1</code>) as single source of truth.</li>
            <li>Non-diagnostic hints around anaemia, bleeding, platelet/clotting awareness, Rh-negative pregnancy risk.</li>
            <li>Re-used by Women+, Diabetes, GLP-1, medication safety, and the Risk Engine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Core-3 — Diabetes / Metabolic</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tracks glucose/A1c signals, weight, GLP-1 response, adherence and behaviour.</li>
            <li>Never prescribes; it surfaces patterns and risk flags for clinicians and the Risk Engine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Core-4 — Mental Health & Wellbeing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mood and energy signals connected to the Dopamine Engine and Phases 3 &amp; 10.</li>
            <li>Safety-first escalation rules for worrying patterns (e.g. very low mood + poor sleep).</li>
            <li>No diagnostic labels – supports safer conversations and escalation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Core-5 — Kids & Family</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Family-level context: guardians, children, shared risk patterns.</li>
            <li>Connects Women+ journeys (pregnancy → postpartum → baby).</li>
            <li>Strictly guardian-controlled and child-safe by design.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Core-6 — Environment / Weather / Context</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-medical context signals such as heat, pollution, seasonal patterns.</li>
            <li>Modulates interpretation of risks without becoming a medical device itself.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Core-7 — Charts & Intelligence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Population-level and cohort analytics: dashboards, heatmaps, AE radar.</li>
            <li>National and clinic views for ministries and providers, fully governed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="subtle">
            Each Core can be enabled, audited, or disabled independently and reviewed separately by regulators and
            ministries. A failure in one Core does not compromise the others.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. SECURITY & GOVERNANCE -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>2. Security &amp; Governance — Per Country, Per Role, Per Feature</h2>
        <p>
            Phase 8 carries the heaviest security and governance layer in the Elisence architecture, with explicit
            separation by country, role, and feature.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Country-Level Security &amp; Policy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Every request passes through a Session Passport / IdP token (OpenID Connect / OAuth2 style).</li>
            <li>Token claims include: <code>user_id</code>, <code>role_v8</code>, <code>org_id</code>, <code>country_code</code>, <code>access_tier</code>, <code>auth_strength</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>country_code + access_tier</strong> decide which Cores, features and views are allowed.</li>
            <li>Governments can require certain Cores to remain OFF and mandate localised thresholds and wording.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="subtle">
            Qatar can run a different activation mix and wording than Saudi Arabia, all on the same global engine.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Role-Based Security (Citizen → Doctor → Ministry)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Formal roles such as citizen, clinician, clinic_admin, hospital_admin, ministry, research_partner.</li>
            <li>Different visibility: citizens see calm guidance; clinicians see structured risk and data quality; ministries see aggregate trends.</li>
            <li>Different authentication strength for each role (MFA, hardware keys for clinical/ministry roles).</li>
            <li>Different action rights; impersonation and cross-role access are blocked and auditable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Zero-Trust Architecture</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No request is trusted by default.</li>
            <li>API gateway checks token signature, expiry, issuer and audience.</li>
            <li>Minimal claims are passed as headers (e.g. <code>X-Elisence-UserRole</code>, <code>X-Elisence-Country</code>).</li>
            <li>If anything is wrong, the request is rejected before entering AHE logic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="subtle">
            Phase 8 cannot accidentally leak risk information to the wrong role or country.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. WOMEN+ IN PHASE 8 -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>3. Women+ in Phase 8 — Women Risk Intelligence &amp; 11K</h2>
        <p>
            Women’s Health has its own dedicated Phase 7, but Phase 8 brings a Women AHE 11K layer into the unified
            Risk Engine and governance model.
        </p>

        <h3>3.1 Women AHE Views</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Citizen view</strong> – calm, non-diagnostic wording, always emphasising that outputs are educational and not a diagnosis.</li>
            <li><strong>Clinician view</strong> – dominant risk level, risk flags, data quality and a structured pathway checklist.</li>
            <li><strong>Ministry view</strong> – aggregated statistics and patterns without PII.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="subtle">
            If the role is unknown, the engine fails safely by falling back to the citizen view.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Women Risk Intelligence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Combines women symptom signals, blood hints, pregnancy context, Rh-negative status and behaviour where available.</li>
            <li>Citizen outputs: soft language encouraging timely clinical review.</li>
            <li>Clinician outputs: structured context and checklists.</li>
            <li>Ministry outputs: population-level patterns and gaps.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="subtle">
            The engine never labels diseases (e.g. “you have X”). It highlights patterns and urges professional review.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. BLOOD / HEMATOLOGY BACKBONE -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>4. Blood / Hematology as Governance Backbone</h2>
        <p>
            The Blood &amp; Hematology Core is a strategic backbone for Phase 8 and for the whole Elisence ecosystem.
        </p>

        <h3>4.1 Unified Blood Schema</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Central model: <code>AHE_Blood_Profile_v1</code> used across Women+, Diabetes, GLP-1, medication safety, and the Risk Engine.</li>
            <li>Prevents each module from inventing its own blood model; simplifies audits and upgrades.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Active Features (ON, Safe to Use)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Read-only blood summaries for citizens and clinicians.</li>
            <li>Non-diagnostic hints like “pattern suggests lower blood levels, please talk to your doctor about anaemia”.</li>
            <li>Rh-negative pregnancy risk hints.</li>
            <li>Use as internal signals for Risk Engine and other cores.</li>
            <li>Provenance and WORM logging when enabled.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.3 Implemented but Intentionally OFF</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ministry dashboards (blood risk heatmaps by region).</li>
            <li>National benchmarks and league tables.</li>
            <li>Automated cohort builders (e.g. anaemia in pregnancy).</li>
            <li>Advanced interoperability bridges.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="subtle">
            These features are coded but OFF. They require national policy, anonymisation rules and explicit ministry sign-off before activation.
        </p>

    <!-- 5. RISK ENGINE -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>5. Risk Engine — Our Own Method, Not a Copy</h2>
        <p>
            The Phase 8 Risk Engine is not a clone of Oxford or any single external score. It is a governed, explainable
            engine inspired by guidelines and open frameworks.
        </p>

        <h3>5.1 Clinical Logic Strategy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Focuses on major conditions: cardiovascular, metabolic, kidney, chronic liver disease.</li>
            <li>Combines demographics, long-term risk factors, behaviour, symptoms, blood signals and medication patterns.</li>
            <li>Uses rule-based clinical logic and explainable probability-style outputs for clinicians.</li>
            <li>Allows countries to plug in their own approved scores in future.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Separate Outputs for Citizens vs Clinicians</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clinicians &amp; ministries</strong> see detailed risk levels, trends and cohorts with full context.</li>
            <li><strong>Citizens</strong> see no percentages or “10-year risk of heart attack” messages; only gentle prompts about healthier behaviour and speaking to a doctor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="subtle">
            This keeps Phase 8 clinically powerful without turning the citizen app into an unregulated medical device.

    <section class="card">
        <h2>6. GI / Organs, Stroke &amp; System-Wide Intelligence</h2>

        <h3>6.1 GI &amp; Organ Signals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>GI-related symptoms (abdominal pain, bowel changes, appetite changes, nausea, unexplained weight loss) are captured in Symptoms/PRO mappings.</li>
            <li>Combined with blood and other signals, they become “pattern hints” that certain patterns need clinical review.</li>
            <li>No GI diagnosis is made inside the app; the goal is better escalation, not replacement of clinicians.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.2 Stroke / Neuro (H2)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Neuro (H2) logic inspired by FAST and related triage thinking.</li>

            <li>Feature-flag controlled (e.g. <code>NEURO_H2_ENABLED</code>) and OFF by default.</li>
            <li>Citizen outputs never say “you are having a stroke”; they use escalation language (“seek urgent evaluation”) without naming diseases.</li>

        <p>
            Charts &amp; Intelligence is where Phase 8 is most visible to ministries and hospital partners:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Risk trendlines for diabetes, cardiovascular, kidney and other chronic conditions.</li>
            <li>Cohort comparisons by region, age band, gender, BMI band, medication type.</li>
            <li>Women+ dashboards (patterns of heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, pregnancy signals, aggregated only).</li>
            <li>Impact evaluation of interventions (campaigns, new clinics, programmes).</li>
            <li>k-anonymity rules to hide small cohorts and prevent re-identification.</li>

    <!-- 9. MEDICAL vs NON-MEDICAL MODES -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>9. Medical vs Non-Medical Modes — ON/OFF by Design</h2>
        <p>
            Phase 8 uses explicit modes to stay on the safe side of regulation while remaining clinically helpful.
        </p>

        <h3>Non-medical mode (default)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Education, wellbeing, self-management prompts.</li>
            <li>Safe lifestyle suggestions, basic explanations.</li>
            <li>No diagnoses and no treatment decisions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Medical-adjacent mode (restricted)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Structured risk intelligence and clinical summaries for doctors.</li>
            <li>Dashboards and cohorts for ministries and hospitals.</li>
            <li>All sensitive engines guarded by feature flags and fail-closed behaviour.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="subtle">
            High-risk modules (Women 11K advanced paths, Blood dashboards, Stroke H2, etc.) are OFF by default, returning
            controlled 503 responses until governance is in place and activation is formally approved.

            <li>Receive structured intake and risk context instead of raw, fragmented history.</li>
            <li>See which signals are driving the risk flags and can judge reasonableness.</li>
            <li>Save time on reconstruction and spend more on decision and patient conversation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>10.3 Hospitals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use hospital-level dashboards for chronic disease and readmission risk.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>10.4 Ministries / Governments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use Phase 8 as a national radar for chronic disease and women’s health.</li>
            <li>Define what to enable, where and for whom.</li>
            <li>Run pilots with specific Cores or regions before full rollout.</li>

    <!-- 11. INVESTOR Q&A -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>11. Investor Q&amp;A — Handling the Tough Questions</h2>

        <h3>Q1 — Is this a medical device? Does it diagnose or prescribe?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> No. Phase 8 is medical-adjacent infrastructure. Citizen outputs are strictly
            non-diagnostic and non-prescriptive; clinician outputs are support, not autonomous decisions. The design
            aligns with NHS / EU MDR / FDA CDS expectations for bounded decision support.
        </p>

        <h3>Q2 — If one Core fails (e.g. Diabetes), does everything collapse?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> No. Each Core is independently governed with feature flags. A failure in Core-3 does
            not make Women or Blood unsafe; Cores can be isolated or disabled without taking the whole system down.
        </p>

        <h3>Q3 — Are you copying Oxford or other proprietary risk models?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> No. The logic is multi-factor, rule-based and explainable. External scores are used as
            inspiration and comparison points, not as proprietary clones. Countries can plug in their own approved
            algorithms later if desired.
        </p>

        <h3>Q4 — How do you control which country sees what?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> Through Session Passport claims, feature flags per country/deployment and strict
            role-based dashboards. Qatar, Saudi and other markets can each have their own activation mix.
        </p>

        <h3>Q5 — How do you avoid AI hallucination?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> Safety-critical logic is deterministic and rule-based. Generative AI is only used for
            summarisation and tone, never for changing risk levels or inventing new facts.
        </p>

        <h3>Q6 — What if regulators say “turn everything off now”?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> Immediate feature flag shutdown per Core, per country and per dashboard is built in.
            The system can degrade to pure education mode.
        </p>

        <h3>Q7 — Where is the business model?</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> National licences, hospital and network licences for dashboards, paid clinician tools
            and future research partnerships on anonymised cohorts. Phase 8 is core infrastructure with clear, repeatable
            revenue paths.
        </p>

    <!-- 12. LIMITATIONS -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>12. What Phase 8 Does Not Claim</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It does not replace doctors, clinics, hospitals or national health systems.</li>
            <li>It does not provide automated diagnosis or treatment suggestions.</li>
            <li>It does not offer fully autonomous emergency triage.</li>
            <li>It is not presented as a certified medical device in all jurisdictions today.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="subtle">
            Instead, Phase 8 positions Elisence as a governed, explainable risk and intelligence layer that sits beside
            health systems, reduces pressure on clinicians and prepares the ground for higher regulatory classes when
            countries are ready.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 13. FINAL POSITION -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>13. Final Position Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Phase 8 is the heart of Elisence:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technically</strong> – multi-core, risk-aware, zero-trust, five-language-ready.</li>
            <li><strong>Clinically</strong> – aligned with safe, explainable decision support instead of black-box AI.</li>
            <li><strong>Governance-wise</strong> – per-country, per-role, per-feature control with kill-switches.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategically</strong> – transforms Elisence from a health app into national-grade health infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It is ready to pilot with ministries in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the wider GCC, to support hospitals and
            clinics in managing chronic disease and women’s health, and to convince even the most cautious investor that
            risk is understood, governance is built-in, and scaling can be done safely, gradually and profitably.
