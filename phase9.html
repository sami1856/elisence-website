    <h1>Diabetes &amp; Metabolic Health Engine</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        Phase 9 is the <strong>Diabetes &amp; Metabolic Health brain</strong> of Elisence – a governed, non-diagnostic
        engine that understands glucose, weight, GLP-1 journeys and metabolic risk, and turns them into safe, structured,
        multilingual intelligence for citizens, clinicians and ministries.
    </p>

    <p class="tagline">
        Built for GLP-1 and diabetes at scale – Zero-Trust, multi-language, regulator-ready, and fully integrated with
        the rest of Elisence.
    </p>

    <!-- 1. WHAT PHASE 9 IS -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>1. What Phase 9 Is</h2>
        <p>
            Phase 9 is the Diabetes &amp; Metabolic Health Engine of Elisence. It focuses on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes.</li>
            <li>GLP-1–based weight-loss programmes and obesity management.</li>
            <li>Metabolic risk for citizens using medication, lifestyle changes or both.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-diagnostic by design</strong> – it never replaces a doctor or prescribes treatment.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk-oriented and education-oriented</strong> – built to support safe decisions, not make them.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-language</strong> – designed from day one for EN, FA, AR, TR, RO.</li>
            <li><strong>Globally compliant</strong> – aligned with NHS, FDA, EU MDR and GCC/PDPL expectations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="highlight-box">
            In one line: Phase 9 turns fragmented diabetes and metabolic data into safe, explainable intelligence that
            supports citizens, clinicians and ministries without becoming a diagnostic device.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. TECHNICAL CORE -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>2. Technical Core — How Phase 9 Works</h2>
        <p>
            The Phase 9 engine brings together multiple data sources and transforms them into structured risk views.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Inputs (Signals into the Engine)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Blood glucose logs (fingerstick, CGM, manual entries).</li>
            <li>HbA1c values and other lab markers (via Phase 8 – Blood Core).</li>
            <li>Weight curves and BMI trends (linked to Phase 3 – Weight &amp; Care).</li>
            <li>Medication data (GLP-1, insulin, oral agents) via Phase 6 – Global Medication Brain.</li>
            <li>Lifestyle signals: activity, steps, sleep, nutrition patterns.</li>
            <li>Symptoms and PRO: hypo/hyper feelings, dizziness, thirst, fatigue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Core Diabetes &amp; GLP-1 Logic</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Risk tagging: tags for hypo-risk, hyper-risk, volatility, poor adherence, fast weight change, etc.</li>
            <li>Threshold ladders: jurisdiction-aware ranges for glucose, A1c and weight dynamics.</li>
            <li>Trend detection: improving, stable, or deteriorating metabolic patterns.</li>
            <li>Zero-Trust checks: low-quality or conflicting data is flagged, not silently accepted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Outputs (What the Engine Produces)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Structured risk snapshots for each user (non-diagnostic, explainable).</li>
            <li>Safe textual explanations in five languages, adapted to role and country.</li>
            <li>Flags for Elisa (Phase 5) to speak about risk in a calm, supportive tone.</li>
            <li>Aggregated analytics for clinics and ministries (when enabled) via Phase 8.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. SAFETY & REGULATION -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>3. Safety &amp; Regulatory Posture</h2>
        <p>
            Phase 9 is designed from the start to be safe for citizens and comfortable for regulators.
        </p>

        <h3>3.1 Dual-Mode Design</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wellness / Education Mode (default)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always ON and ready to deploy to the public.</li>
                    <li>Provides education, lifestyle guidance and gentle risk awareness.</li>
                    <li>No diagnosis, no treatment decisions, no numerical risk promises.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Medical-Adjacent Mode (restricted)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provides tighter thresholds, structured risk views and dashboards.</li>
                    <li>OFF by default and only enabled by ministries or accredited clinical partners.</li>
                    <li>Controlled through feature flags, environment variables and governance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Alignment with Major Frameworks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>NHS</strong> – aligned with diabetes self-management and safety messaging guidelines.</li>
            <li><strong>FDA Non-Device CDS</strong> – users can understand the basis of outputs; no opaque decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>EU MDR</strong> – stays outside direct diagnosis/prescription; built as decision support and education.</li>
            <li><strong>GCC / PDPL</strong> – supports data residency, privacy and public-health analytics boundaries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Zero-Trust &amp; BBVP</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Zero-Trust: no guessing of values; uncertainty is surfaced and users are asked for clarification.</li>
            <li>BBVP (Build-Back-Verify-Prove): each engine and threshold must be tested and evidenced before being claimed as DONE.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. DATABASE & STRUCTURE -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>4. Data Structures &amp; Evidence Layer</h2>
        <p>
            Phase 9 uses clearly defined schemas that make every decision traceable and auditable.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>diabetes_profiles</strong> – long-term context: diagnosis status, type, duration, comorbidities.</li>
            <li><strong>glucose_events</strong> – timestamped readings with source, units and confidence.</li>
            <li><strong>medication_intakes</strong> – linked to Phase 6 with dose, timing and confidence flags.</li>
            <li><strong>lifestyle_events</strong> – activity, sleep, nutrition, stress markers.</li>
            <li><strong>risk_snapshots</strong> – frozen views of risk tags, thresholds and explanations at each evaluation.</li>
            <li><strong>audit_logs</strong> – WORM-style logs for regulators and internal QA.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="subtle">
            This structure allows a regulator or ministry to see exactly how a risk message was generated, which signals
            were used, and which thresholds were applied.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PHASES -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>5. Integration with Other Phases</h2>
        <p>Phase 9 is deeply connected to the rest of Elisence:</p>

        <h3>5.1 Phase 4 — Governance &amp; Analytics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Diabetes risk results flow into comparative intelligence and RWE analytics.</li>
            <li>WORM ledger and provenance ensure traceable exports and dashboards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Phase 5 — Elisa Personality &amp; Dopamine</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Elisa uses Phase 9 signals to coach users kindly about risk, adherence and lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Healthy Dopamine engine rewards safe behaviours (logging, movement, checks), not extremes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 Phase 6 — Global Medication Brain</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Medication understanding (names, doses, timing) is delegated to Phase 6.</li>
            <li>Phase 9 uses structured medication events to reason about GLP-1 and diabetes regimens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.4 Phase 7 — Women+ &amp; Phase 8 — AHE</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Women+ pathways include metabolic and pregnancy-related diabetes, feeding back into Phase 9 rules.</li>
            <li>AHE Core-2 (blood) and Core-3 (diabetes) reuse the Phase 9 logic for national dashboards and risk engines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.5 Phase 13 — Voice / Zero-Typing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Citizens can speak naturally (“Elisa, my sugar was 210 after dinner”).</li>
            <li>Speech is transcribed, interpreted by Phase 6 &amp; 9, then turned into safe, voice-ready explanations.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. REAL-WORLD USE CASES -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>6. How Phase 9 Is Used in Real Life</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Citizens</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Track glucose, weight and medications with minimal friction (including voice).</li>
            <li>Receive gentle, multilingual explanations about patterns: “improving”, “stable”, “needs attention”.</li>
            <li>Get nudges to move, hydrate, sleep better and speak to clinicians earlier.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.2 Women+ Users</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Women using GLP-1 or at risk of gestational diabetes get integrated support via Phases 7 and 9.</li>
            <li>Signals are handled with extra caution and clear non-diagnostic language.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.3 Clinicians &amp; Clinics (when enabled)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>View structured risk summaries, trend charts and adherence patterns for their own patients.</li>
            <li>Use Elisence as a time-saving intake and context layer, not as an automatic decision-maker.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.4 Ministries &amp; Public-Health Teams</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor anonymised GLP-1 adoption, adherence and metabolic trends at population level.</li>
            <li>Evaluate impact of national programmes (education, medication access, lifestyle campaigns).</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- 7. INVESTOR & REGULATOR QUESTIONS -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>7. Investor &amp; Regulator Questions</h2>

        <h3>Liability — “Are you acting like a virtual doctor?”</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Answer:</strong> No. Phase 9 never diagnoses or prescribes. It provides structured risk awareness and
            educational guidance, with clear “this is not a diagnosis” posture in every jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h3>Safety — “What about hypo/hyper-glycaemia risk?”</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Answer:</strong> Potentially dangerous patterns trigger strong escalation messages (“seek urgent
            medical help”, “contact your clinician”), not home treatment instructions or dose changes.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Quality &amp; Bias — “Can we trust the numbers?”</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Answer:</strong> All data goes through Zero-Trust cleaning; low-quality or conflicting data is flagged,
            and risk outputs clearly indicate uncertainty. Thresholds are calibrated to avoid dangerous false reassurance.
        </p>

        <h3>Scalability — “Can this handle national-scale data?”</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Answer:</strong> Phase 9 is designed for pre-computation of aggregates, efficient querying and horizontal
            scaling, so ministries can monitor millions of events per day.
        </p>

        <h3>Jurisdiction Switching — “How do you handle UK vs EU vs GCC?”</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Answer:</strong> The engine reads jurisdiction from Passport (country, system) and applies appropriate
            ranges, wording and policy boundaries per deployment.
        </p>

        <h3>Voice — “Is voice safe in multiple languages?”</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Answer:</strong> Voice (Phase 13) is governed by the same safety rules. Low ASR confidence or unclear
            phrases lead to clarification prompts, not silent assumptions.
        </p>

    <!-- 8. GCC & NATIONAL STRATEGY ANGLE -->
    <section class="card">
        <h2>8. GCC, Qatar &amp; Saudi – National Diabetes Strategy Partner</h2>
        <p>
            For GCC markets, Phase 9 is designed as a strategic partner for national diabetes and obesity programmes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Supports GLP-1 programmes, lifestyle interventions and early-risk awareness.</li>
            <li>Respects cultural context: diet patterns, family structures, Ramadan rhythms and activity habits.</li>
            <li>Provides five-language capability and deep Arabic &amp; Farsi support at engine level.</li>
            <li>Allows governments to start in safe wellness mode, then gradually activate advanced features when governance is ready.</li>

        <h2>9. Final Position Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Phase 9 makes Elisence a serious, governed partner for diabetes and metabolic health:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For citizens</strong> – a calm, multilingual companion that explains risk and supports healthier choices.</li>
            <li><strong>For clinicians</strong> – a structured, explainable context layer, not a competing “AI doctor”.</li>
            <li><strong>For ministries</strong> – a scalable, privacy-respecting engine for national metabolic intelligence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It is zero-hype, evidence-based, regulator-friendly and commercially attractive – ready to sit at the centre
            of national GLP-1 and diabetes strategies in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the wider GCC and beyond.
