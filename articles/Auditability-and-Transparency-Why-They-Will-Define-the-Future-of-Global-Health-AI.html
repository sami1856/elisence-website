        <h2>1. Health AI Without Audit Is a Black Box</h2>
        <p>
          When an AI system touches health decisions — even in a non-diagnostic way —
          a simple question appears:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>“If something goes wrong, can we see what happened?”</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Without a clear audit trail, the answer is usually “no”.
          That is not acceptable for families, clinicians or ministries.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Why Transparency Matters to Everyone</h2>
        <p>
          Transparency is not only for regulators.
          It matters for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>citizens, who want to know how their data is used</li>
          <li>clinicians, who need to understand what a system is doing</li>
          <li>ministries, who must defend decisions in front of the public</li>
          <li>investors, who care about long-term stability and risk</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In health, “just trust us” is not a serious answer anymore.
        </p>

        <h2>3. What Real Auditability Looks Like</h2>
        <p>
          A serious Health AI platform should be able to show:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>who accessed which data, and when</li>
          <li>which rules or models were used for each decision</li>
          <li>what inputs were received and what outputs were generated</li>
          <li>how versions changed over time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is where technologies like WORM (Write-Once Read-Many) audit logs become essential.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Zero-Trust + WORM: A Strong Combination</h2>
        <p>
          In Elisence, Zero-Trust and WORM go hand in hand:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Zero-Trust limits who can act.</li>
          <li>WORM records what actually happened.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Together, they create a traceable, tamper-resistant history that can be reviewed
          by internal teams, external auditors or regulators when needed.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Transparency in Language, Not Only in Logs</h2>
        <p>
          Audit logs are important, but people also need clear explanations in normal language.
        </p>
        <p>
          A transparent Health AI platform should:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>explain its limits and non-diagnostic posture</li>
          <li>describe in simple words how decisions are made</li>
          <li>avoid hiding behind technical jargon</li>
          <li>offer easy-to-read summaries for families and clinicians</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Regulators Are Moving in the Same Direction</h2>
        <p>
          Around the world, regulators are converging on the same idea:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>if a system affects health, it must be explainable</li>
          <li>if it uses AI, it must be governed</li>
          <li>if it stores sensitive data, it must be auditable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This makes auditability and transparency not just good practice,
          but a strategic advantage for modern Health AI platforms.
        </p>

        <h2>7. How Elisence Was Designed for an Audited Future</h2>
        <p>
          Elisence was built with the expectation that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>ministries will ask for detailed logs</li>
          <li>hospitals will need clear evidence of behaviour</li>
          <li>independent reviewers will test safety claims</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That is why Elisence uses:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Zero-Trust access control</li>
          <li>WORM-style audit records for critical flows</li>
          <li>non-diagnostic, non-prescriptive safety rules</li>
          <li>an evidence-first mindset instead of slogans</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In the next decade, global Health AI will be defined by one simple question:
          <strong>“Can you prove what your system did, and why?”</strong>  
          Platforms that can answer clearly will lead the future — and Elisence is built to be one of them.
