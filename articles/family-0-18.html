  <p>Connecting health, growth, school, digital safety, and emotions in one safe layer.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Educational only:</strong>
    This article describes how Elisence organises information for families.
    It is not a diagnostic tool and does not replace paediatric, psychological,
    or emergency care.
  </div>

  <h2>Families Need a Joined-Up View</h2>
  <p>
    Many families use different tools and systems for different parts of a child’s life:
    a school portal, a growth chart, a separate app for sleep, another place for mental health,
    and various social media and messaging channels.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>Family Ecosystem (0–18)</strong> in Elisence is designed to bring key elements together
    in one, safer place — for parents, carers, and (where appropriate) young people themselves.
  </p>

  <h2>What the Family Ecosystem Covers</h2>
  <p>
    The Elisence Family module focuses on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Growth and basic health indicators (non-diagnostic, trend-focused)</li>
    <li>Sleep patterns and routines</li>
    <li>School and learning signals (such as attendance or focus)</li>
    <li>Digital safety and screen-time patterns</li>
    <li>Emotional check-ins and stress indicators</li>
    <li>Family bonding activities and shared moments</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Digital Safety and Healthy Dopamine</h2>
  <p>
    Children and teenagers spend many hours online.
    The goal of Elisence is not to monitor every click,
    but to give families a clearer view of patterns:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rough usage windows (for example: late-night, during school hours)</li>
    <li>Signs that balance between rest, school, and screens may be off</li>
    <li>Educational guidance on healthy, sustainable digital habits</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Emotional and Mental Well-Being</h2>
  <p>
    For younger people, emotions can change quickly.
    Elisence offers gentle ways to log and reflect on mood,
    energy, and stress — always as education and support,
    never as a clinical diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Parents can be supported with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simple, age-appropriate explanations</li>
    <li>Ideas to open conversations at home</li>
    <li>Guidance on when to consider speaking with a professional</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Respecting Privacy and Autonomy</h2>
  <p>
    Information about children and teenagers must be handled with care.
    Elisence is designed so that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is minimised and protected</li>
    <li>Families can see what is being stored and why</li>
    <li>Young people’s privacy expectations grow as they become older</li>
    <li>Any aggregated insights for schools or ministries are anonymised</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>From Families to Systems — Without Exposing Individuals</h2>
  <p>
    At a higher level, the Family Ecosystem can support anonymised insights:
    for example, trends in sleep, stress, or digital balance across age groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    These signals can help schools, communities, and ministries design better support,
    without revealing any individual child’s identity or private story.
  </p>

  <p>
    Elisence’s Family Ecosystem aims to be a quiet, trustworthy layer under family life —
    helping parents and carers feel less alone, and helping systems respond more intelligently.
