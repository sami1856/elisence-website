        <h2>1. Women+ Health Is Not One Single Moment</h2>
        <p>
          Women+ Health is not just one phase of life.
          It stretches from early puberty to menopause and beyond — cycles, hormones,
          pregnancy, postpartum, emotional health and everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
          No single app can capture this complexity with one screen and a few buttons.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Why Simple Tracking Apps Are Not Enough</h2>
        <p>
          Many apps today only count days or ask users to tap symptoms.
          They often miss what really matters:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>context around stress, sleep and pain</li>
          <li>emotional impact and daily functioning</li>
          <li>long-term patterns over months and years</li>
          <li>the difference between “common” and “concerning” patterns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Women deserve more than colourful calendars. They deserve intelligent support.
        </p>

        <h2>3. What “Intelligence” Means in Women+ Health</h2>
        <p>
          In Elisence, intelligence does not mean diagnosis.
          Instead, it means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>organising symptoms and events into clear patterns</li>
          <li>highlighting when something changes significantly</li>
          <li>helping users prepare better conversations with clinicians</li>
          <li>supporting decisions without replacing medical advice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Safety, Dignity and Zero-Trust by Design</h2>
        <p>
          Women+ data is deeply sensitive.  
          That is why Elisence uses Zero-Trust principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>no automatic access between accounts</li>
          <li>role-based views for coaches or clinicians, when invited</li>
          <li>WORM audit logs for high-risk actions</li>
          <li>data minimisation for every dashboard and export</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal is simple: intelligence without exposure.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Culture, Language and Real Life</h2>
        <p>
          Women+ Health is also shaped by culture, family expectations and language.
          A serious platform must speak to real life in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>different languages and reading levels</li>
          <li>different family and social situations</li>
          <li>different health systems and regulations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Elisence was built to support multi-language, multi-region Women+ journeys from the start.
        </p>

        <h2>6. The Next Decade of Women+ Health</h2>
        <p>
          The next decade will not be defined by “one more period app”.
          It will be defined by platforms that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>respect women’s time and intelligence</li>
          <li>protect privacy with Zero-Trust</li>
          <li>turn everyday experiences into structured, explainable insights</li>
          <li>stay clearly non-diagnostic and transparent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Elisence was created to be part of that new standard for Women+ Health —
          built with intelligence at the centre, not as an afterthought.
        </p>
