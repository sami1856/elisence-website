  <h1>Women+ Health — Why It Matters</h1>
  <p>How Elisence supports women’s journeys with education, structure, and safety-first intelligence.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Important:</strong> This article is educational only. Elisence does not provide diagnosis, emergency advice,
    or medical prescriptions. For any urgent or worrying symptom, users should contact a doctor or emergency service.
  </div>

  <h2>Why Women+ Health Needs a Dedicated Space</h2>
  <p>
    Women’s health is often split across many apps and systems: one for periods, another for pregnancy,
    a separate place for mood tracking, and different records in clinics and hospitals.
    Important details can be lost, repeated, or misunderstood.
  </p>
  <p>
    Elisence treats <strong>Women+ Health</strong> as a core, first-class domain.  
    Phase 7 of Elisence is devoted to helping women understand their own data and patterns in a way that is:
    respectful, non-judgmental, multi-language, and always safety-first.
  </p>

  <h2>What Women+ Health Covers in Elisence</h2>
  <p>
    The Women+ module in Elisence is designed to support a wide range of life stages and topics, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cycle awareness and pattern tracking (regular, irregular, heavy, light)</li>
    <li>PMS and emotional impact, with gentle educational support</li>
    <li>Pregnancy journeys and postpartum recovery (non-diagnostic, supportive guidance)</li>
    <li>Pain, bleeding, or other symptoms that may need medical attention, with clear “red-flag” awareness messages</li>
    <li>Energy, mood, sleep, and stress around hormonal changes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Elisence Supports Women Safely</h2>
  <p>
    Elisence does not replace doctors, midwives, or emergency care.  
    Instead, it helps women:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Organise and remember what is happening over time</li>
    <li>See patterns that may be important to discuss with a professional</li>
    <li>Receive educational messages written in clear, human language</li>
    <li>Access the same ideas in multiple languages, for families and communities</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Behind the scenes, Women+ Health in Elisence is carefully aligned with safety principles and public clinical
    guidance (such as NHS/NICE style thinking), so that the language stays educational and supportive,
    not diagnostic or prescriptive.
  </p>

  <h2>Privacy and Respect</h2>
  <p>
    Women’s health information is deeply personal. Elisence is built so that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is minimised and protected wherever possible</li>
    <li>Users keep control over what is stored, shared, or deleted</li>
    <li>Any sensitive analytics or national insights use anonymised, aggregated patterns</li>
    <li>Feature-flags can keep advanced functions off until the right governance is in place</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why This Matters for Families, Clinics, and Ministries</h2>
  <p>
    When Women+ Health data is safely structured, it can help in three ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>For individuals</strong> — better understanding of their own body, mood, and cycles.</li>
    <li><strong>For clinics</strong> — clearer timelines and patterns to support professional judgement.</li>
    <li><strong>For ministries &amp; public health</strong> — high-level, anonymised signals about needs,
        pressure points, and gaps in services, without exposing personal details.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Elisence Phase 7 is designed to become a trusted reference layer for Women+ Health —  
    not by replacing healthcare, but by connecting everyday experience with safer, clearer information.
