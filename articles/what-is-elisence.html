  <h1>What is Elisence?</h1>
  <p>A Global Health Intelligence Platform for People, Clinics, and Ministries</p>

  <h2>From Isolated Apps to One Trusted Ecosystem</h2>
  <p>
    Today, health information is scattered: one app for weight, another for diabetes, a separate system for hospitals,
    and different tools for children, mental health, and nutrition. None of them truly connect, and very few are
    built with the level of safety that ministries, hospitals, and families actually need.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Elisence</strong> is designed as a single, integrated health intelligence ecosystem. Instead of “one more app”,
    it is a platform that connects people, clinics, national systems, and safe AI into one consistent experience —
    always with privacy, clinical governance, and human well-being at the center.
  </p>

  <h2>The Core Idea</h2>
  <p>
    Elisence is a multi-phase platform. Each phase focuses on a specific domain of life and health, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Women+ Health &amp; Life Companion (Phase 7)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Diabetes &amp; GLP-1 Intelligence (Phase 9)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Family Ecosystem 0–18 (Phase 15)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Global Nutrition &amp; Diet Intelligence (Phase 16)</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Mental Health &amp; Calm Support (Phase 17)</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All of these modules sit on top of a shared, secure infrastructure:
    Zero-Trust security, WORM audit logs, privacy-first identity (Passport V1), and a multi-language experience
    that supports English, Farsi, Arabic, Turkish, and Romanian.
  </p>

  <h2>Who Elisence Is For</h2>
  <p>
    Elisence is built for three main groups:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>People &amp; Families</strong> — a safe companion for daily health, women’s journeys, children’s growth,
        diabetes, mental well-being, and nutrition.</li>
    <li><strong>Clinics, Hospitals &amp; Professionals</strong> — a structured way to view trends, risk flags,
        and educational insights without replacing clinical judgement.</li>
    <li><strong>Ministries, Public Health &amp; Insurers</strong> — aggregated and anonymised intelligence
        that can be used for planning, early warning, and policy design, without exposing individual citizens.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Safety First, Always</h2>
  <p>
    Elisence is not a diagnostic tool and does not replace doctors or emergency services.
    The platform is designed around non-diagnostic, educational and supportive guidance,
    respecting clinical standards such as NHS/NICE and international digital health frameworks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every module is built with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Zero-Trust security</strong> — every request is checked, never blindly trusted.</li>
    <li><strong>Auditability</strong> — key actions can be traced and reviewed when needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy-first design</strong> — personal data is minimised, protected, and controlled by the user.</li>
    <li><strong>Feature-flags</strong> — more sensitive clinical features stay off by default until the right
        governance is in place.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where Elisence Is Going</h2>
  <p>
    The long-term vision is to connect individuals, clinics, and national health ecosystems in a way that feels
    simple and human, while meeting the expectations of regulators, ministries, and international partners.
  </p>
  <p>
    As new phases go live, Elisence aims to become a reference point for safe, transparent,
    and multi-language health intelligence — a bridge between everyday life and trusted healthcare.
