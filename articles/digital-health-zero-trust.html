  <h1>Zero-Trust in Digital Health</h1>
  <p>Why Elisence treats every request as untrusted — and how that protects real people and systems.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">

  <div class="note">
    <strong>In simple terms:</strong> Zero-Trust means “never trust by default”.  
    Every request, device, and connection must prove who it is and what it is allowed to do.
  </div>

  <h2>Why Traditional Trust Models Are Not Enough</h2>
  <p>
    Many older health systems were built on the idea of an internal “safe network”.
    Once a user or system was inside the network, it was assumed to be trusted.
    In modern healthcare, this assumption is no longer safe:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>People access systems from many locations and devices</li>
    <li>Cloud services, APIs, and mobile apps all interact with sensitive data</li>
    <li>Cyber attacks and misuse can come from both outside and inside a network</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For a platform like Elisence — which serves families, clinics, and ministries —
    a stronger, more modern security posture is required.
  </p>

  <h2>What Zero-Trust Means in Elisence</h2>
  <p>
    In Elisence, Zero-Trust is not a slogan. It is a practical rule set:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Every request is checked, even if it comes from a “known” device or user</li>
    <li>Permissions are specific to each action, not “all or nothing” access</li>
    <li>Data paths are minimised so that only what is needed is shared</li>
    <li>High-risk actions can be logged in WORM-style audit trails</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This approach reduces the impact of stolen passwords, misconfigured systems,
    or technical mistakes. A single weak point is less able to compromise the whole system.
  </p>

  <h2>Working Together with Governance and Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Security on its own is not enough for digital health.  
    Elisence combines Zero-Trust with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Governance</strong> — clear rules about what each module is allowed to do</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy</strong> — data minimisation and user control wherever possible</li>
    <li><strong>Auditability</strong> — the ability to review important actions when needed</li>
    <li><strong>Feature-flags</strong> — keeping advanced functions off until frameworks are ready</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why It Matters for People, Clinics, and Ministries</h2>
  <p>
    For individuals, Zero-Trust means their data is not simply “open” once they log in;
    the platform respects boundaries around each part of their health story.
  </p>
  <p>
    For clinics and hospitals, it supports safer integrations and clearer separation
    between different types of information and roles.
  </p>
  <p>
    For ministries and public health bodies, it builds confidence
    that national-level intelligence can be generated without lowering security expectations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Elisence treats Zero-Trust as a baseline requirement —  
    a foundation for every phase, from Women+ Health to Diabetes, Families, Mental Health, and beyond.
